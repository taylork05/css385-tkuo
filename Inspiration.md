My initial inspiration for the game I desire to build comes from auto battler games like Teamfight Tactics and Super Auto Pets. Elements from Teamfight Tactics that I'm particularily interested in are the traits and economy. The traits that each unit have can create a team with synergy(s) that can benefit or give an advantage to the user's team. Economy is a deeper part of the game which more seasoned players become proficient at allowing them to better understand when to spend their gold, as SAP gives a set amount of gold per round. TFT allows for the user to get a bonus depending if they are on a win streak, lost streak and amount of gold they currently hold. What I admire about SAP is the simplicity of the units and it's clean mechanics that are easy to understand. Taking from both is the RNG and use to items. RNG of the items they could get have a set percentage chance of each but when applied to units and upgrading charaters there is a set pool of the number available. Items are a prominent tool for users I would like to add as they make games less uniform and allow for more creative possibilities.
